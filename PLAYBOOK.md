## My experience with this project

Fill in here a brief summary of your experience with the project. What did you
learn?

This was a fun and fairly easy project. Once I understood the involved methods I pretty easily got it working. I definatly learned how to work with telnet in python. It wasn't hard for me since I know python pretty well.
